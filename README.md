# hello-world
I strave to become a programmer at the age of 48. It probably sounds weird, that I want to become a programmer at my age, but I am hit with a physical disease called CMT which in short means that my nerves in the peripheral limbs are bracking down so walking and handling tools getting harder and harder. Thereby I have to reprograme my competencies from being managing and hands on in the construction industry toward being able to offer new business competencies in a more physically stationary job function position.
